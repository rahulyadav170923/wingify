Urls :
1) /products - to get and post products
2) /products/<product_id> - to get and put (update), delete specific products
3/users- Post here to create users [ username and passwor header necessary ]

Authorisation is done using username and Authorisation Header like the one written in the unittests.

3) Put-  to update a given product
            a) content-type must be 'applicatio/json'
            b) 'id' field is manndatory
4)Delete- /products/productid to delete a goven product



Some Decions made :
1) Instead of sending error codes in the Http request i have sent 200 for each one and added msg nad sttus code in the json. Twitter does some of its apis endpoints this way. This is merely a personal choice.
2) I haven added a database to keep the code same in both production and localhost
3) There is no structure to product details apart fro mit needs a given 'id'(manadatory). I generally use sqlalchemy for such tasks.

To run in local machine:
 1) "python setup.py"
 2) "python app.py"

 To run tests :
 Run local server and run tests in another terminal (remember to use "source venv/bin/activate" to activate virtualenv)
